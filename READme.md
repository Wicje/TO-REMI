##Buildingphase
Phase 1 â†’ Core Expansion (cement ownership & error handling)

âœ… Add/Edit/Delete/Clear tasks.

âœ… Track completion.

ðŸ†• Edit task details (description, due_date).

ðŸ†• Clear completed tasks.

ðŸ‘‰ Skills youâ€™ll sharpen here:

Mutable vs. immutable borrows (&mut Task when editing).

File I/O round-tripping with updated data.

Error handling when task index doesnâ€™t exist.

Phase 2 â†’ Priorities & Organization (play with enums & pattern matching)

Add priority: enum { Low, Medium, High, Critical }.

Add categories (string or enum).

Filtering by status/priority/category.

Sorting by due date/priority.

ðŸ‘‰ Skills:

Enums & match statements.

Iterating & filtering collections.

Error handling when filters donâ€™t match anything.

Phase 3 â†’ Dates & Time (learn chrono crate)

Due dates (chrono::NaiveDate).

Overdue task highlighting.

Filtering by date.

ðŸ‘‰ Skills:

External crate usage (chrono).

Parsing/formatting dates from user input.

Error handling on invalid dates.

Phase 4 â†’ Advanced Features (big brain Rust)

Recurring tasks (generate next occurrence).

Subtasks/Dependencies (nested structs).

Statistics (counting tasks).

Calendar view (group by date).

ðŸ‘‰ Skills:

Struct composition.

Lifetimes (if you reference subtasks).

More complex borrow-checker fights.

Phase 5 â†’ Persistence & Sync

Swap JSON â†’ SQLite (diesel or sqlx).

Import/Export.

Backups.

Maybe sync with a cloud service (once async networking is introduced).

ðŸ‘‰ Skills:

Database integration.

Traits + modular storage backends.

Async/await (tokio) when syncing.

Phase 6 â†’ UI/UX Enhancements

Colored output (colored crate).

TUI (cursive/tui-rs).

Interactive mode with arrow keys.

Progress indicators.

ðŸ‘‰ Skills:

Terminal UI design.

Handling async input/output cleanly.
